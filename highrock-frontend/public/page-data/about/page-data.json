You are always in control of your account."},{"id":"About-faqs_5","question":"What is a Conflict of Interest in the investment industry?","answer":"Good examples would be when a mutual fund company pays an advisor to sell its funds (trailer fees) or when Advisors who are paid a commission based on the assets under their administration which puts client’s needs as secondary to their own personal revenue generating activities.

The results of the Wealth Forecast form our investment decisions on how much risk a client needs to take to meet their goals.
